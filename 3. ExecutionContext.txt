Understanding the Execution Context
Execution Context is like a container which holds two phases:
> Memory Allocation Phase(variable environment)
> Code Execution phase
The whole process of execution Context is managed by the JS engine with the help of its own call stack or Execution Context Stack. 
Call Stack maintains the order of execution of execution context. 
In EC there will be only one GlobalEC and another for the function invocation(the number of local will depend on number of functions present in the code). 
These local ECs will immediately pop out when they are done with their execution.
GEC will delete only after the whole code execution is done.
